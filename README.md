Body Mass Index - BMI

## Calculate your Body Mass Index

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.

The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration. Use the "Metric Units" tab for the International System of Units or the "Other Units" tab to convert units into either US or metric units. Note that the calculator also computes the Ponderal Index in addition to BMI.
